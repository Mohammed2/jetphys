31.8.16. LXPLUS usage, cleaning up and modernization (Hannu)

fillHistos:
 - Centralized includes fillHistos.C -> fillHistos.h
 - Removed the (redundant) explicit branch declarations from fillHistos.h
 - Changed t4_EvtHdr__mEvent from UInt_t to Int
 - Added missing branches to PFJets (but these are not loaded)
 - Added an adaptive method for handling triggers: uninteresting triggers are denoted by a blank ("") or in the output by the letter "x"
 - LXPLUS running options:
   - Run everything in one run
   - Run piecewisely, hadd the results (be sure to change the filenames or locations!)
   - Run in batch; the files are parsed together using hadd
