To start using this package, first clone it from git
   git clone https://github.com/miquork/jetphys.git
   cd jetphys

Then we need to check out some additional packages:

* jet energy corrections (JEC) software from jecsys package in git:
  cd ..
  git clone https://github.com/miquork/jecsys.git
  ln -s jecsys/CondFormats jetphys/
  cd jetphys

* JEC text files from JECDatabase in github:
  https://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase/tree/master/tarballs/Summer15_50nsV5.tar.gz
  [save this to CondFormats/JetMETObjects/data]
  cd CondFormats/JetMETObjects/data
  tar -xzf Summer15_50nsV5.tar.gz
  cd ../..

* RooUnfold:
  svn co https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/unfolding/RooUnfold/trunk RooUnfold
  cd RooUnfold; make; cd ..
(see also: http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/~adye/software/unfold/RooUnfold.html )

Copy data files, and add a symlink

Then, gen.

Nowadays it is best to run one step at a time. At least 1, 2a and 2b tend to be useful.
For plotting purposes there is the script drawFracs.C. This is operated by
mk_mcPlots.C and mk_generalPlots.C. These are designed for streamlining the process
of generating various plots with the same script. That is, different parameter
valuues, which have an effect on the mode of operation.
